					<description>Following exposure to mutagenic mechanites, a slender red wolf snout has replaced this pawn's face completely with a set of fangs and pointed teeth.  It's perfect for biting and tearing through meat, but depending on the exact form the mutation has taken it may severely hampen their ability to speak.</description>

							<description>A slender, red wolf snout graces [PAWN_nameDef]'s face, completely with a set of fangs and pointed teeth.  Almost no human traits remain, making speech incredibly difficult. Many people find [PAWN_possessive] fangs and [PAWN_possessive] tendency to growl rather than talk intimidating</description>

[PAWN_pronoun] has even developed a bit of a "poker tail", meaning [PAWN_possessive] can avoid giving away [PAWN_possessive] mood when trying to trade or during poker night.</description>
